### Metrics

```text
What are the qualitative objective? (e.g., reduce user churn)

What is the quantifiable metrics? (e.g., reduce the fraction of users with 4-week inactivity)

Quantify what improvement in the values of the metrics are useful for the customer scenario? (e.g., reduce the fraction of users with 4-week inactivity by 20%)

What is the baseline (current) value of the metrics? (e.g., current fraction of users with 4-week inactivity = 60%)

How will we measure the metrics? (e.g., A/B test on specified subset for a specified period)
```
